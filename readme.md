# Essential Emoji

This is a small collection of custom [Slack](https://slack.com) emoji I made, which covers some very obvious oversights by the Unicode Consortium. These emoji can be installed using the [EmojiPacks](https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks) CLI Tool.

They were created to match the Apple emoji style, and work best when using that style with Slack.

## List of emoji

_flexed-biceps-right_: A reversed version of the Flexed Biceps emoji (üí™), to allow people who have two arms to show off their guns ... ![flexed-biceps-right demo](http://i.imgur.com/58ypYCD.png "Welcome to the gun show")
